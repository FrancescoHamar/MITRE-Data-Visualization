MITRE DATA Viewer

Accessing Mitre Database through stix:
 - Language choice: Python, supported through stix2 library
 - Choosing how to access: Download all data vs Live access (email mentioned scraping or servers so i used live data)

Learning Stix and Taxi
 - Understanding how objects are queried
 - Understanding Filtering
 - Problem! TAXII Server Response with different amount of objects! Setting per_request=13  
	- https://github.com/OTRF/ATTACK-Python-Client/issues/43  || Seems to not be an issue as manual checks confirm the results

Understanding File format
 - Figuring out types and relationships
 - Mitigation types between files change id. For example "Data Loss Prevention" course of action, will have a different id in 
enterprise and in ics for example. This holds for both stix and att&ck Ids.
 - Figuring out relationships

About the problem in particular:
 - After having looked through all of the above and thinking about code formatting this is conclusion:
	- Query relationships between mitigation and techniques : Hashmap from target to source and viceversa
	- Find link between datasources and attacks
 - Quite unsure whether the datasources refer to the external references, but I will assume so after not having found anything better
	- Resources appear repeated sometimes, as multiple articles are used from certain sources, this could call for multiple logging
of the resources per item, or simply count them as one


Code Formatting
 - Parsing sources combined vs one by one. Duplication pushes me towards handling everything one by one
 - Abstracting finding relationships by mitigation and by attack technique
 - I believe that the above comment does not hold for the external references to attack link as it is a different relation and hierarchy
 - Should I use a class for external resources to contain both name and url, or simply count the resources per name (?)
