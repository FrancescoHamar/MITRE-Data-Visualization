MITRE DATA Viewer

Accessing Mitre Database through stix:
 - Language choice: Python, supported through stix2 library
 - Choosing how to access: Download all data vs Live access (email mentioned scraping or servers so i used live data)

Learning Stix and Taxi
 - Understanding how objects are queried
 - Understanding Filtering
 - Problem! TAXII Server Response with different amount of objects! Setting per_request=13  
	- https://github.com/OTRF/ATTACK-Python-Client/issues/43  || Seems to not be an issue as manual checks confirm the results

Understanding File format
 - Figuring out types and relationships
 - Mitigation types between files change id. For example "Data Loss Prevention" course of action, will have a different id in 
enterprise and in ics for example. This holds for both stix and att&ck Ids.
 - Figuring out relationships

About the problem in particular:
 - After having looked through all of the above and thinking about code formatting this is conclusion:
	- Query relationships between mitigation and techniques : Hashmap from target to source and viceversa
	- Find link between sources and attacks



Code Formatting
 - Parsing sources combined vs one by one. Duplication pushes me towards handling everything one by one
 - Abstracting finding relationships by mitigation and by attack technique
